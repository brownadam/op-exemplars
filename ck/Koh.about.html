			<p>Hi, I'm Christy Koh. Currently, I am a junior attending Dublin High School.</p>
            <p>In addition to being team captain of the <a href="http://www.dhsrobotics.com"  target="_blank">Gael Force Robotics</a> Vex Competition Team 5327C, I am the secretary for my school's Chemistry Club. My favorite class this year is AP French. Math and Science are my forte, a fact reflected in both my coursework and extracurricular activities. I am currently enrolled in my school's Engineering and Design Academy, on the Computer Science Pathway.</p>
            <p>I have a strong engineering background which was established when I was young. My father is an engineer; it goes without saying that his career had an early influence on my childhood. My parents helped me to build up a strong foundation in Mathematics and Science from an early age. For a period of four years, I studied in Singapore before coming to America. The rigorous standards set by the Singaporean education system strengthened my understanding of many basic concepts and principles in all subjects. After moving to America, while still in elementary school, I started learning to program using Python. In middle school, I took a <a href="https://www.pltw.org/"  target="_blank">Project Lead the Way</a> (PLTW) Gateway to Technology (GTT) course on Engineering Design and Robotics.</p>
            <p>Last year, I took a PLTW Principles of Engineering Course. I was able to experiment in <a href="Koh.projects.html">creating a variety of robots and mechanisms</a>, and learned to program in basic C as well as code Netlogo simulations. 3 years of adventure and challenge in the <a href="http://www.dhsrobotics.com"  target="_blank">DHS Gael Force Robotics Club</a> has lent me critical thinking skills as well as valuable technical experience in mechanical engineering, robot control systems, and leadership. Thank Ford I learned something useful in high school.</p>
            <p>One of my best qualities is my focus and dedication. When I set my mind to accomplish a goal, whether it be a simple homework assignment or a major project, I always direct all my efforts into my work with a single-minded focus until I achieve it. Not only do I meet the standards set for me, I also make every effort to exceed them. I feel that it is very important to continually challenge myself to do the best I possibly can.</p>
            <p>Not only do I dedicate myself to my work, I also am an insatiable learner. I am naturally curious; I feel the need to know the reasoning behind everything. I often come up with random questions, then seek out the answers for myself. The more I learn, the more I realize that there still remain so many fascinating concepts and ideas to explore. I'm looking forward to gaining knowledge and experience for a future career in engineering!</p>
