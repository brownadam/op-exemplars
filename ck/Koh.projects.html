					<h3>VEX Robotics</h3>
					<p><strong>Team</strong>: Gael Force 5327C</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: August 2015 - present</p>
					<p>I am a member of the DHS Robotics club. At the beginning of my freshman year, I joined the VEX Robotics Competition team 5327C as one of the two freshmen on the team. Last season, I was lead builder on team Gael Force 5327D during the challenge Starstruck. In June, I was elected team captain of team 5327C. My role on this team will be to make decisions for my team, and coordinate the efforts my team members. At competitions, I liaise with other teams and organize alliances. This year's challenge is called "In the Zone". Details and rules of the game can be found <a href="http://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/competition/competition-resources/" target="_blank">here</a> and there is a video describing the game<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yo_mlR1VJU" target="_blank">here</a>. This year's game is, to me, the most interesting and challenging yet. I'm looking forward to a very successful season ahead!</p></div>

					<h3>Machine Control Design: Elevator</h3>
					<p><strong>Course</strong>: Principles of Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: May 2016</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Design and program an elevator to convey passengers between three floors.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team</p>
		            <p>I worked on this project in a group of 4 students. The project's aim was to construct an elevator that could carry a person between three different floors, as well as to program the elevator to respond to call buttons to convey the passenger to and from floors in any combination. An additional requirement was a safety feature that would signal the elevator to return to the ground floor after a predefined period of inactivity. </p>
		            <p>As a team, we brainstormed 4 different designs. They ranged from a winch system to pulley systems to a rack and pinion system. Working together, we completed the design matrix and decided to follow through with constructing the rack and pinion powered elevator. We utilized 3 bump switches for external call buttons, 3 limit switches for buttons on the lift, and an ultrasound sensor to measure the height of the elevator at any given point of time. The program was quite simple, and we used two simple functions to control the elevator's movement to a destination and for the safety feature to return the elevator to the ground floor. The most challenging part of this project was working with the VEX linear slides. They created a lot of friction and caused our motor to stall when the lift was trying to go up or down. I resolved this problem by using right angle brackets to mount the linear slide inserts on, making the elevator more flexible. This resolved the problem by greatly reducing the amount of friction the elevator experienced. Our elevator ended up functioning superbly. If we had more time, we would have loved to add an elevator door, lights to indicate the floor, as well as sound effects.</p>

					<h3>Solar Hydrogen Vehicle</h3>
					<p><strong>Course</strong>: Principles of Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: November 2016</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Prototype a vehicle powered by solar or hydrogen cells.</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team</p>
		            <p>I worked on this project in a group of 4 students. The project's aim was to investigate the effectivity of hydrogen versus solar cells, and how connecting them in parallel versus series would affect its performance.</p>
		            <p>As a team, we brainstormed different designs and came up with a design proposal for a 3-wheeled car. The most challenging part of this project was working with the limited materials we had. Unfortunately the previous classes had taken all the wheels, so we had to resort to using treads. After going through several revisions of our design, we finally made it such that the vehicle could run in a straight line without stalling. For our vehicle, solar cells wwere the most efficient, exerting a force of 1.7N and yielding an efficiency of 47.9%. Our vehicle was not fast, but it was relatively efficient!</p>

					<h3>Fallon Engineering Lab</h3>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: August 2015 - present</p>
					<p>I am a student mentor for the <a href="fallonengineeringlab.weebly.com">Fallon Engineering Lab</a> at Fallon Middle School.</p>
					<p>For 3 hours every Saturday, I guided middle school students in programming a line-following robot using the Python programming language and a Raspberry Pi. In addition to programming, I instructed students on how to wire up a breadboard, connecting the Pi's GPIO pins to Motor Driver and ADC chips.</p>
					<p>Even before beginning to teach the project, I worked for many weeks with my dad to create a working demo robot. For this project, my focus was to develop the line-following sensor interface with the Raspberry Pi using SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface). This subroutine that I wrote was used as part of a higher-level line-following program to control the movement of the robot.</p>
					<p> I immensely enjoyed being a part of Fallon Engineering Lab. Not only did I learn many new concepts in programming, engineering design, and application of chips, I also learned how to effectively debug programs. I also learned to communicate with adults experienced in the field. Ultimately, the experience of mentoring younger students made me a better engineer myself.</p>

					<h3>2016 Entrepreneurship Project</h3>
					<p><strong>Course</strong>: Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: May 2016</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Solve a real-world problem using programming skills</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team</p>
		            <p>I teamed up with fellow computer science student Neha Harpanhalli to tackle the Entrepreneurship Project. The project's aim was to identify a problem existing in the real world and apply skills learned in our Computer Science and Software Engineering course to solve it. </p>
		            <p>We decided to create an app for students at our high school to track their graduation progress as catered to their desired diploma. We conducted a survey of over 90 students, discovering that 3 in 4 students feel that graduation requirements are difficult to keep track of; 90% would use a graduation tracker app. In a simple overview screen, the app visually displays a student's progress specific to their diploma of choice, notifying them of their progress in credits and volunteer hours. The app also tracks students' coursework, volunteer hours, and activities all in one place. We used AppInventor to create the basic prototype for this application, but we will be further developing the product over the summer for actual implementation in DHS by Fall 2016.</p>
		            <p>Our product placed 2nd in my CSE class, and we won second place in the 2016 DHS Engineering and Design Showcase Competition.</p>

					<h3>Text Adventure</h3>
					<p><strong>Course</strong>: Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: February - March 2016</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Program a text adventure game in Python</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team</p>
		            <p>As a team, we decided to make our game based on a murder mystery. We decided that the text adventure would allow the player to question suspects and search for clues to deduce the murderer. To map out the basic layout of our game, we created a flowchart diagram that showed the choices the player could make, and the resulting outcomes. Utilizing programming concepts learned earlier on, we programmed the choices into our game. One of the constraints placed on this project was that we were not allowed to use while loops. Because of this limitation, we encountered one significant problem in a very simple function: asking the player for 'yes' or 'no'. We wanted to make sure that if the player gave an invalid answer or made a typo, they could have a chance to answer the question again without restarting the game. Because we could not use a while loop to continually check for a correct response, we had to use recursion. After extensive testing, we learned that using return was causing our function to exit out of the recursion early. Instead, we modified the function to change a global boolean variable. This project was a fun one; it allowed me to express my creativity and deepen my understanding of how conditionals in Python work.</p>

					<h3>App Inventor</h3>
					<p><strong>Course</strong>: Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: December 2015 - January 2016</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Create a photobooth app using MIT App Inventor 2</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team</p>
		            <p>For this app inventor project, we selected the app tutorial we wanted to start with from the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/tutorials.html" target="_blank" >MIT App Inventor Tutorials</a> site. We chose to do the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1trt9smFfyiztdVoaq5ONaOM8GWOMoSFxTRJ7Eyyajuw/pub" target="_blank" >Photobooth tutorial</a>. After completing the tutorial, we brainstormed ways we could expand and enhance the app. We decided to add an editing function that allowed the user to select and edit an image to edit and then share. I did majority of the programmming and design of our app. One of the challenges that presented a major problem to the development of our app was  We also had to spend time figuring out how to transfer an image from the photobooth to the editor. We used TinyDB to save the image under a tag and then retrieve it when the editing screen was opened. This project helped me to learn the basics of creating an app; the programming, the layout, and how to cater to users' convenience.</p>

					<h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
		            <p><strong>Course</strong>: Computer Science and Software Engineering</p>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: November 2015</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Create an engineering portfolio using HTML</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Individual</p>
		            <p>Another project during the first quarter was creating this engineering portfolio using HTML/CSS. To develop my HTML/CSS skills, I completed multiple courses on CodeCademy. As with all projects, I had several features in mind that I did not know how to program myself. To find solutions to these problems, I made use of online resources such as <a href="https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/index.html" target="_blank">"yet another insignificant...Programming Notes"</a> by Nanyang Technological University. For instance, I did not know how to make a description appear over my thumbnail images. After searching the web for examples, I found an example on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2941189/how-to-overlay-one-div-over-another-div" target="_blank">stackoverflow.com</a>. By learning from the example, I was able to achieve the effect on my home page. Overall, this project helped me to learn the basics of how to design and program a website in HTML.</p></div>

					<h3>Scratch</h3>
		            <p><strong>Course</strong>: Computer Science and Software Engineering</p> 
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: September 2015</p>
					<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Create an enjoyable Scratch game with increasing difficulty</p>
					<p><strong>Type of Project</strong>: Team</p>
					<p>Our assignment was to create a game using Scratch by MIT. The game we created is an escape-the-room game with a twist; instead of trying to escape a room, you are trying to help a character get into various rooms of his house. We used various algorithms to switch views, allow the player to collect keys, and to record the total time taken to complete the game. The only problem was that we mostly created our sprites and backgrounds and typed out all our code from scratch. By taking code from other examples and using sprites available online, we would have been able to take a lot less time to achieve the same result. As a whole, this project helped me to review the basic structure of coding and creating algorithms.</p>

					<h3>Mini Lantern</h3>
					<p><strong>Date</strong>: July 2015</p>
		            <p>I made this Mini Lantern out of an empty lip balm tube, a button cell lithium battery, and a small LED.</p>
					<p>In actuality, it is a very simple construction. First, I cut the lip balm tube to hold the battery, then used the cap to secure it in place. Next, I pierced two holes through the cap to allow the anode and cathode of the LED to touch the battery and allow current to flow through. I also cut a small sliver of plastic and slipped it on one side of the battery so that I could control whether the LED turns on or off. The beautiful lampshade was folded with patterned origami paper, then glued onto the cap.</p>
		            <p>At first, the lamp was not very well balanced because it had a high center of gravity. I solved this problem by pouring small pieces of gravel into the bottom of the lip balm tube to weight the base. This greatly improved the stability of the mini lantern. It took me several tries to get the switch to work in an effective way. I wanted the light to stay off as a default, but when I pressed the switch I wanted the light to turn on until I released the switch. The only flaw in my design was that sometimes the anode would bend if I pushed too hard or for too ling, causing the the light to stay on even if I released the switch.</p>
					<p>Overall, this project helped me to put into practice my engineering design skills, while creating a visually appealing decoration.</p></div>
