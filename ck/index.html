						<h2>Singapore</h2>
						<p>I am Singaporean by birth. My family came to California so that we could be together with my father, who works in the Bay Area. I've made a lot of friends and enjoy it in the US, but I'm still a Singaporean at heart.</p>

						<h2>Basketball</h2>
						<p>I started playing basketball in 5th grade. My grandfather used to be a basketball referee, and he coaches me in skills, drills, and strategy. I have played basketball through all 3 years of middle school, and I represented Dublin High's Lady Gaels on the junior varsity team freshman year. I love the teamwork embedded in the game; the deep bonds formed between team members is invaluable and irreplaceable.</p>

						<h2>Leadership</h2>
						<p>I have taken on the role of a leader many times. In middle school, I was a project manager for CJSF; I was in charge of over 100 students. In this picture, I was the House Captain for the Euclidean Yellows Team when I was in Fallon Math Club.</p>

						<h2>Service</h2>
						<p>I am a passionate advocate for giving back to the community that has already given so much to me. For many hours a week, I help out in my church, at Fallon Engineering Lab, or at the library. I enjoy community service and I do it for the experience, not just the hours.</p>

						<h2>Speech & Debate</h2>
						<p>In middle school, I took my first speech and debate class. Ever since, I've become actively involved in speech and debate.</p>
						<p>Between speaking and debating, I enjoy debating much more. I'm a very logical person, and building up well-supported and well=reasoned cases is one of my strong points. Despite being highly competitive, Lincoln-Douglas debate has to be my favorite type of debate.</p>
