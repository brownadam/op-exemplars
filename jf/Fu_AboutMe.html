                        <p><font size="3">My goal is to make a difference in the world around me. From just 1% of people having internet access in 1995 to over 40% today, access to internet has been growing rapidly. The internet has become a place where people can quickly access all sorts of information, and freely express all their thoughts and feelings about almost anything. People from all around our world use the internet everyday for communication, education, social, business and entertainment purposes. The internet is a place with infinitely many possibilities, and I hope to one day help further expand the possibilities of the internet.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="3">Ever since I was little, I have enjoyed destroying and taking apart things, but also creating and making things. I love learning how things work. In 4th grade, after I discovered origami I began to express my creativity and who I was through every piece. This is very similar to code, because we can use code to truly express who we are, similar to an artpiece - which is why I enjoy coding. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="3">In four years, I plan to attend either the University of Santa Barbara or the University of Michigan, and aquire a bachelors degree in computer science. My passion is to expand and explore the endless possibilities of the internet, and through doing so hope to pursue my passion about making a difference in the world.</font></p>
                        <p><font size="3">What sets me apart from other programmers is the reason why I code. While others may develop websites, they offer their services at high prices. This is where I will bridge the gap. I find programming fun, and I believe that no matter what job we have, or how much we make, we should choose a job that we love, and this is why I would like to be a web developer.</font></p>
