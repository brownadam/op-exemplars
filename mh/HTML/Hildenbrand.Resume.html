			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<p>I am an ambitious math and engineering student at Dublin High. 
			In the fall I will be attending University of California, Berkeley,
			majoring in Civil and Environmental Engineering. My aspiration as a future
			civil engineer is to better people's lives with new and innovative 
			technologies and structures, which can be accomplished with my persistence 
			and curiosity. I hope to be challenged technically and continue to learn
			and grow as an engineer throughout my life. </p>
			<h4>Education</h4>
			<p><i>Dublin High School, Class of 2016</i></p>
				<p>I maintain a 4.29 GPA at Dublin High School (DHS) and am within the top 9% of students in my school.  My coursework includes an ambitious portfolio of AP and honors-level academic courses, including participation in the Dublin High School Design and Engineering Academy.  I am also a member of Project Lead the Way, the nation's leading organization of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs.  Representative course work includes: Introduction of Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering, Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Computer Science and Software Engineering, AP Calculus AB, AP Statistics, AP Biology, Honors Chemistry, and Physics.</p>
				<p>In addition to my academic work at DHS, I am the goalkeeper on the Varsity soccer team, a runner on the Track and Field Team, a lifetime member of the California Scholarship Federation (CSF) club and Girls Exploring Technology, Science, and Engineering Together (GETSET) club.</p>
			<h4>Athletics</h4>
			<p>I am active on three separate athletic teams, all at the competition level:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>US Club Premier League Soccer: Goalkeeper and defender with team captain experience (2002-2015)</li>
			    <li>DHS Varsity Soccer: Goalkeeper (2013-2016)</li>

	        </ul>
			<h4>Experience</h4>

			highlights include: 4 years of California Scholarship Federation volunteer activities, earning the title of a Lifetime Member, 6 years of 
			volunteer activity with the Tri-Valley YMCA, and active volunteer service in two Dublin City Council elections. In the YMCA, I was a program leader in the junior girls program, helping to coordinate several volunteer events annually including Open Heart Kitchen food drives, winter clothing drives, and grounds rehabilitation at the Oakland Zoo.</p>
			<p>In addition to volunteering, I had an internship through the Metropolitan Transportation Commission working with the City of Dublin's Public Works Department. I worked closely with both civil and traffic engineers, gaining valuable experience in the field. I was responsible for filling out Capital Improvement Plan applications, creating cost estimates for streetlight conversions, updating the geographical information system for the City, and various other tasks such as expanding the Green Shamrock Business Program, looking over encroachment permits, updating the Street Overlay in AutoCAD Civil 3D, and submitting a Bicycle Friendly America Community application.</p>
			<h4>Languages</h4>
			<p>In addition to my primary English language, I am also competent in both oral and written Spanish.</p>
