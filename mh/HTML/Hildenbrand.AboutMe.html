					<h3> About Me </h3>
					<p> My name is Madison Hildenbrand and I am a senior at Dublin High School. I aspire to be a civil engineer and
					find new, sustainable ways to solve problems relating to infrastructure and the environment. Ever since I was little
					I was exposed to building structures and have learned to love and appreciate how things both are built and work as 
					I grew older.  </p>
					<p> I am currently enrolled in Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Computer Science and Software Engineering,
					but my other relevant coursework includes Introduction to Engineering Design, Principles of Engineering, 
					Honors Chemistry, AP Biology, Physics, AP Statistics, and AP Calculus. I am certified in Autodesk Inventor 
					(May 2014) and am able to use AutoCAD Civil 3D, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Excel, and Google 
					Drive. I have also interned with the City of Dublin's Public Works Department, giving me real, hands-on experience 
					in the field of civil engineering by filling out funding applications, creating cost conversions, updating the 
					Geographical Information Services, expanding the Green Shamrock Business Program, and nationally recognizing the City 
					as Bicycle Friendly. Some of the projects that I worked on that can be seen today in Dublin are the green bicycle lanes, 
					restriping along Dublin Boulevard, new traffic signs and street striping by schools, and the new LED lights in East Dublin. 
					Projects that I worked on that will be implemented in the future include adding a median, bicycle lanes, and pedestrian
					crosswalks to Amador Plaza Road (Spring 2016), the bicycle and pedestrian bridges across Dublin Blvd and Dougherty Road 
					(approx. 2020) and the expansion of Dublin Blvd from Dougherty Road to Sierra Road (approx. 2017). I am very proud of my work
					since I know that it positively impacts residents on a daily basis. My internship cemented my passion for civil engineering 
					and I am excited to pursue it in the future. I will be attending University of California, Berkeley, in the fall, majoring
					in civil and environmental engineering and I hope to pursue a minor in architecture as well.</p>
					<p> In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking, and walking my dog. I have played soccer for fourteen years on premier 
					league teams and have been on the school Varsity team for three years. I practice everyday and am extremely passionate
					about the sport. I am also active in multiple school clubs,	including California Scholarship Federation (CSF) Club and
					Girls Exploring Technology, Science, and Engineering Together (GETSET). Through my participation in soccer and CSF, 
					I have learned the importance of collaboration and compromise. These experiences have showed me what it is like to be not 
					only a team member but also how to lead a group of people and be able to be successful in doing so.  </p>
					<p> My ultimate goal as an engineer is to better people's lives with new, innovative technologies and to create a world 
					to be proud of. Thank you for your time and please feel free to explore the rest of my portfolio. </p>
