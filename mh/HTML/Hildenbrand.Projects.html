					<h4> CNC Milling </h4>
					<h5> May 26 2016, Computer Integrated Manufacturing </h5>
					<p>The goal of this project was to mill a design on a piece of hard foam that included
					at least one line and one arc. The design had to fit on a 2"x2"x1" block. I created
					a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bzt4mZZcw13UYkJzeHdrWkZ0Z3M">G&M code</a> that specifically worked with our BenchMill 6000.
					This was my first experience with a CNC Mill and I learned that you have to be extremely careful with every movement you make in order to 
					ensure that your final product looks like what you anticipated. I also learned that you need to continuously check your code to verify 
					that the machine will function properly and safely.</p>

					<h4> Image Manipulation </h4>
					<h5> May 8 - May 12, 2016, Computer Science and Software Engineering </h5>
					<p>The goal of this project was to create a python code that would alter every image in a specific folder in at least
					two different ways. My partner and I decided that we wanted to alter the images so that a border and a
					watermark would be added and fit to any size or orientation of picture. This projct really helped me better understand
					python and its different applications. It really challenged my partner and I since we had to do a lot of research as to
					how image manipulation works and how to make one code fit all pictures.

					<h4> Hangman </h4>
					<h5> March 21 - March 24, 2016, Computer Science and Software Engineering </h5>
					<p>The goal of this project was to create the traditional hangman game using the language Python. This was to give us 
					exposure to loops, which was the basis of our program. We made our hangman food themed, and the user had five lives.
					With each incorrect guess, a life was taken away. If the user correctly guessed the word, they won the game. At the end

					<h4> 3D Printing Connectors - Chandelier </h4>
					<h5> March 2016, Computer Integrated Manufacturing </h5>
					<p>  The goal of this project was to 3D print connector pieces that would be able to hold together CDs, straws, and/or popsicle
					sticks. This was an open-ended project that had very few constraints. My partner and I could create anything that we wanted,
					as long as it consisted of the materials listed above, with the addition of rubber bands, the material was less than 2 cubic
					inches, and that we used at least eight connectors in our project. We decided to make an original and aesthetically pleasing product.
					After a lot of brainstorming, my partner and I decided that we could best do this by creating a chandelier. We made one central holder
					for the popsicle sticks, so two sticks went one way while two sticks went the other way. Using Autodesk Inventor, we modeled and printed ten connectors that 
					use 1.183 cubic inches of material. There is a small hook on the top of this piece so that a rubber band can be strung through it, creating a
					hangar that can hold a wall hook for the top so that the chandelier can be put onto a wall. One straw fits in between each popsicle 
					stick, so we used four straws total. On the top of each straw there is a clamp that holds the popsicle sticks and straws together so 
					that they are held at a uniform level. On the bottom of the straw, there is a connector piece that is a medallion with a peg sticking 
					upwards and the peg uses tension to grip the straw. This piece lets a CD rest on top of the medallion and the straw can go through the
					middle of the CD. LEDs can be added to the bottom of the CD to add a cool light effect, especially since the light is reflected off 
					of the bottom of the CD. The design itself is fairly simple, but we had to come up with many different ideas on how to hold all of the
					items and give enough strength to the straws to be able to be held up while also holding onto the small CDs. If you want the CD's to 
					be hung at different levels, you can cut the straws to length. My partner and I were really happy with how our project turned out, it
					looked nice and we were able to change the design to fix the challenges we had. I learned that there are simple solutions to hard 
					problems, but in order to make these solutions work you need to be able to think outside of the box and have accurately measured 
					products. The measurements of our printed pieces were true to design. On our CD holder, the total diameter was exactly the same as the
					model. The holes on the inside were supposed to be .157 inches and turned out to be .154 inches, which is very close. For our wall hook,
					the diameter was supposed to be 1 inch and it was really .998. The extrusions, however, for both the base and the hook itself were
					exactly what they were supposed to be. The connector piece for the popsicle stick holder was also almost exact to the design. The
					height was exactly the same. The width of both of the sides were supposed to be .875 inches but came out to .880, .005 inches off. 
					The holes on the inside were fairly accurate, they were between .007 to .12 inches off of the design. All of our pieces worked together,
					so these small measurement differences did not make a difference in the final product.</p>

					<h4> MIT Android App Inventor: No Texting While Driving </h4>
					<h5> January 2016, Computer Science and Software Engineering </h5>
					<p>The goal of this project was to create a working Android application using MIT App Inventor. My partner and 
					I decided to make a no texting and driving application because we believed that it would be a useful and relevant
					app, especially for teenagers. Our app is simple and designed to not distract the driver if they recieve a message
					while driving and need to immediately send a response. When a text is received, it defaults to being read aloud but
					there is an option to turn this off for privacy. The driver then has three options for how to respond to the message:
					three predetermined messages that send with the press of a button, a speech-to-text option, and typing a message. The
					predetermined messages are "I'm driving and will respond later", "I will arrive shortly", and "I just left and am on 
					my way". If the driver decides to type a response, a message shows up for the passenger to type it so that the driver
					is reminded that they should not be texting and driving. There is also an option that allows for the driver to press a
					button to automatically call back the number that texted them. The
					<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt4mZZcw13Uc3N0QW5KRWVtVzA/view?usp=sharing">.apk file</a> of the app can be 
					downloaded onto any Android device for use. This project was my first experience in making an application and also allowed
					for me to work on my problem solving and logic skills.</p>

					<h4> Delivery System </h4>
					<h5> December 2015 - January 2016, Computer Integrated Manufacturing </h5>
					<p>For this project, my team and I had to create a delivery system that would transport objects to predetermined places. We
					had to have a working program and prototype and an Autodesk Inventor model of our delivery system. My team created a delivery
					system that was a flat car with a claw on the side and a bump switch and potentiometer. The claw was situated on the side of the
					delivery system so that it would be able to pick up objects but not obstruct the path of the car. The delivery system began when the
					potentiometer was spun and stopped when the bump switch was pressed. The claw picks up an object, moves for a certain amount of
					time, drops the object, picks up another object, and repeats indefinitely. We also had to calculate the cost of implementing these
					delivery systems into large warehouses. Our delivery system came out to be $139, but when the parts are bought in bulk the price decreases.
					To be implemented into warehouses, the delivery systems would need to be built at different heights. Since the claw is at a fixed height,
					the delivery systems would also have to be at different heights so that they would be able to pick up objects from different level
					shelves in a warehouse. I was responsible for making the program and making modifications on the prototype.

						<h4> City of Dublin Public Works Internship </h4>
						<h5> June 2015 - August 2015</h5>
						<p>  Over the summer I was an intern with the <a href="http://www.mtc.ca.gov/">Metropolitan Transportation Commission</a> and the <a href="http://www.ci.dublin.ca.us/92/Public-Works-Engineering"/> City of Dublin Public Works
						Department</a>. I worked closely with civil engineers on traffic and environmental issues. I was given ownership of my own projects including:  
						completing project funding applications, expanding the Green Shamrock Business Program, updating the Geographic Information System,
						creating cost conversions for putting LEDs into decorative lights, painting bicycle lanes and bicycle lane conflict zones,and 
						certifying the City as being bicycle friendly. I also helped with the planning on restriping the roads around schools and 
						how to stripe roads near the new Amador Elementary School. I also helped redesign Amador Plaza Road in Dublin to make 
						it safer for drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists, and these changes will be implemented in 2016. I also learned how
						to program traffic signal cabinets by going into the field and reprogramming them as backup batteries were added to them.
						Along with this, I met with contractors at build sites and learned about the work needed to build a housing development both 
						under and above ground level. Through this experience I learned that I love civil engineering and want to pursue it 
						in my future. It is incredibly rewarding to be able to see my work in the community and want to be able to continue create infrastructure that benefits a community. </p>

					<h4> Platform Design </h4>
					<h5> March 2015 </h5>
					<p>  I had to create a free-standing platform that would be able to hold a spa and drop 29 inches into a deck. This platform needed to support a 
					dry weight of 847 lbs, filled weight of 3,975 lbs (375 gallons of water), and a fully loaded weight of 5,200 lbs (6 adults).
					The top load capacity was 100 lb/sqft. I needed to draw up a site plan that showed not only the install location but also
					the location of the septic and leach lines on the property to ensure the spa could not be contaminated by the septic system.
					The final product was created using cement supports on the bottom with four beams held together by trusses, column bases, and joist hangars.
					I also needed to find the type of wood and supports needed to be able to support the fully loaded weight and have the structure be safe.
					After receiving the permits to build, my family and I spent a weekend building the platform itself.</p>

					<h4> Entrepreneur Project: Bike and Ped Button </h4>
					<h5> May 2015, Principles of Engineering </h5>
					<p>  The objective of this project was to create an invention or innovation that was completely original. 
					I created a new walk button for cross walks. This new button, the Bike & Ped Button, has two buttons instead of the
					preexisting one. The first button would be the exact same as what exists today in regards to allotting time for a person to 
					cross. The second button would be different and specifically geared towards runners and bikers. This button allots less 
					time for a person to cross the street. By allowing a shorter amount of time for a person to cross, cars do not need to 
					idle their cars in the cross walk for an unnecessarily long amount of time, thus reducing their emissions. This solution 
					could reduce approximately one million pounds of CO2 emissions per day. My <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wnpvKZjjjuieKO43f3ZZvR8QwquVyWc8adwRn1LPF50/edit?usp=sharing">

					<h4> Solar and Hydrogen Vehicle </h4>
					<h5> November 2014, Principles of Engineering </h5>
					<p>  The objective of this project was to design, create, and test a prototype that utilizes both solar and hydrogen fuel
					cells to power a vehicle. The car would have to be wired in parallel or series so that the user would be able to use one 
					or two solar cells, one or two hydrogen cells, or one solar cell and one hydrogen cell to power the motor of the car and
					move the car for at least on meter. My team built a lightweight vehicle so that the car would be able to travel as far as
					possible. As project manager, I made sure that my team was meeting deadlines and creating the best vehicle possible. I 
					was also in charge of wiring the vehicle and the calculations. I wired the two hydrogen cells in parallel and the two 
					solar cells in series. After we ran the trials for the vehicles and their different cell configurations, my team had to 
					decide which of the energy sources was most efficient. We concluded that the hydrogen cell was more efficient and effective 
					in moving the prototype since one hydrogen cell was able to power the motor to run the car whereas two solar cells were 
					not able to do this. After we documented our findings, each team member was responsible for creating their own Net Logo
					GUI that accurately depicted how each car ran with each energy source and wiring configuration. This project taught me 
					about different energy sources and their benefits along with electrical wiring and how to properly create circuits. </p>

					<h4> Mechanical Winch System </h4>
					<h5> October 2014, Principles of Engineering </h5>
					<p>  The project objective was to harness electrical energy as mechanical energy. This was to be done by creating a 
					closed circuit that powered a mechanical winch system. The winch system was capable of lifting at least a 100 gram 
					weight thirty centimeters and it was turned on and off with a switch. My team decided to use a pulley to act as the winch
					due to its stability and simple construction. My specific role in the project was to create a simulation of the winch in
					Net Logo. The program simulates the weight being lifted by the mechanical winch. In the program, the winch size, angular
					speed of the winch, mass of the weight, and voltage of the power supply is capable of being altered to simulate different scenarios the mechanical winch could encounter. In this project, I was introduced to code
					and how to overcome challenges in writing code during this project. The code can be seen <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzt4mZZcw13URklQaGxEMnZSWDA/view?usp=sharing">
					here</a> if NetLogo is installed onto your computer. This project also helped to show me the advantages	of dividing 
					aspects of the project among all members of the team for success along with the importance of collaborating 
					between aspects of the project to perfect the final product. </p>

					<h4> Project Compound </h4>
					<h5> September 2014, Principles of Engineering </h5>
					<p>In this project, my team and I designed four simple machines that worked as one cohesive unit to work as 
					one machine that could accomplish a task, pouring a cup of water. The simple machines we used were an axle driving
					wheel, a pulley, inclined plane, and a first class lever. By spinning the axle, the wheel was powered to pull a box
					containing a ball by a pulley. The ball, once the box was high enough to tilt, went down an inclined plane and 
					dropped to hit a first class lever. The lever's opposite end lifted to tip a cup on an axle, which then poured 
					water into an output cup, ready for the consumer to drink. This project taught me how to make multiple machines 
					work as one and how to use different ideas and modify the design for success. Along with this, it gave me a deeper 
					understanding of how machines work and how to use them to complete and overall goal.</p>

					completed the user can turn the lights off. There is one light at the base of each pill compartment for each day,
					and each light is on its own individual series circuit. This project used previous knowledge of Autodesk Inventor,
					simple circuits, and basic building skills. Along with all of this, my partner and I had to create documentation and a

					include: a farm, bridge, boat, dam, supermarket, city hall, bus stop, apartment building, business sky rise,
					windmill, and hospital. We used this project as a way to develop our skills in Inventor by creating 
					intricate buildings that had a meticulous attention to detail. The world is also very compact to make it easy
					for the residents go from their house to work and run errands. The boats and buses are the only transportation
					in the world, which reduces congestion and emissions. My role was to create the bus stops, apartment complex, supermarket,
