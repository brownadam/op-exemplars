                            <p> My name is Joanne Baek and I am currently a high school junior attending Dublin High School.
                            Because I enjoy biology as well as engineering, I want to combine the two and pursue biomedical engineering (BME).
                            To reach this goal, I have applied to and been accepted into the Engineering Academy at my school.
                            Currently I am enrolled in the Computer Science/Software Engineering (CSE) course, where I learn the fundamentals
                            of computer programming. I will take at least one more engineering course before I graduate high school, in addition
                            to the Principles of Engineering (POE) class I took last year. Some major accomplishments of my high school career are
                            receiving both the Academic BLock D and Honor Pin, founding two clubs, and being accepted into the Project Lead the 
                            Way (PLTW) Engineering Academy. The majority of my classes I have taken or am taking currently are rigorous classes, 
                            and I have worked hard to maintain straight A's. I am slowly learning to balance several aspects of my life at once
                            while putting my best efforts into all of them, because they all affect who I will become in the future.
